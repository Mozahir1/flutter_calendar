[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Mozahir1/flutter_calendar/blob/main/LICENSE)

A Flutter package that allows you to easily implement all calendar UI and calendar event functionality in your application with enhanced American date formatting and consistent week display.

## Enhanced Features

- **American Date Formatting**: All headers display dates in m/d/y format with month names
- **Consistent Week Display**: Month view always starts weeks on Sunday for proper grid alignment
- **Month Names**: Beautiful month names instead of numbers in all views
- **Smart Week Headers**: Concise format for same-month weeks (e.g., "September 15-21, 2024")
